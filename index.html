                Hacktoberfest is digital ocean's annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure-including some of digital ocean's own products-relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don't have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

        Contributing to open-source isn't just for technical folks who want to write code. There are lots of opportunities to use your professional skills in support of open-source projects. This year, we're making a point to encourage contributions that require some technical experience or none at all. No matter your experience, you can participate in hacktoberfest!

        Hacktoberfest welcomes people of any experience level to participate, and low-code and non-code contributions are fantastic choices for folks who don't have a lot of technical knowledge.Here are some examples of ways you can contribute to open-source projects:
        ~ Writing & Translations
        ~ Technical Documentation
        ~ Design
        ~ Testing
        ~ Graphic Designing
        ~ Video or Media Production

      When a project is open source, that means anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.
      Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. Also because it gives users a potential to control their own computing, relative to closed source. For example, a business using open source software has the option to hire someone to make custom improvements to the software, rather than relying exclusively on a closed source vendor's product decisions.

      Free software refers to the same set of projects as open source. Sometimes you'll also see these terms combined as “free and open source software” (FOSS) or “free, libre, and open source software” (FLOSS). Free and libre refer to freedom, not price.

      <p>Just me, myself and I, exploring the new universe of Open source projects. I have a heart of love and a interest of changing the world by contributing in projects. I want to share the experience of my new world with you.
      Contributing to Open Source and projects can seem like a daunting process. Your favorite search engine will return a ton of results on guides and repositories to get started. But many times, your search does not yield the result you want, you still do not know how to contribute to Open Source even after reading multiple blog posts.
      <br>
      I have been there myself. I trawled through pages to find great Open Source repositories to contribute to, only to notice that I did not know how to start.Frustrated and a little disappointed, I started focusing on other projects instead.
      Then, NOVUS NEURONS, the reputed technical club of my college sent a message on the group about HACTOBERFEST, and that's where my journey began. I started reseach reagrding the same but couldn't get much benefits from that. Then the club gave me the opportunity of learning all about open source projects and that's when I started the contributions from the very basic.While trying to make my first contributions, I realised that my biggest unknown was not how to add links to markdown or style a page. But how to make a good pull request using git and the command line. The process was slightly less intimidating but it was perfect for a beginner.Not only the contributuions made me intrigued, but the step by step required to find out the open source project, where you can give your share in the making, from the hundreds of projects placed in front of you was also an engaging activity. The process followed being the very basic one- you read new terms, find the meaning and discover new corners of the tech world, and all this is done by yourself. As for the results, one cant be sure of getting the desired outputs but the deep-rooted self-satisfaction in your heart would remain constant throught your hardworking ride!!! 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4 ><b>You are a contributor</b></h4>
      <p> Finding the open source project meant for you requires equal amount of hardwork, energy and enthusiasm. Every indiviual has their own ups and downs in the ride to their first successful contribution. Some have a idea bout it and are just trying it for the first tme while few might be hearing these words for the very first time. For a few this might be just a yearly contributions, while others might be still struggling to understand the basic procedure regarding the same. Whichever category you belong to, everyone has a start some day and you are already here for trying to change the future of development in this technical industry.Just remember this throughout the journay that THE FUTURE CHANGING PROFESsIONALS WERE IN YOUR PLACE SOMETIME IN LIFE!!! </p>
